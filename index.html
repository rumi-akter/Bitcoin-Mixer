        <h4 class="tittle1 mt-4">Keep your funds untraceable with the reliable Bitcoin mixer</h4>
        <p class="seo"> Since the dawn of the digital age, millions of users have made a switch to Blockchain that is claimed to change the way we pay for goods and conduct transactions. No wonder it is a game-changing technology that makes a difference and brings complete privacy. But what you might not know is that Blockchain records all transactions in its publicly available ledger, meaning that third parties can trace them should the need arise. If it’s not that level of confidentiality you’ve expected, be sure to take advantage of our coin mixer.</p>
        <p class="seo">CryptoMixer is a Bitcoin mixing service (also known as a tumbler or blender) that is centered around the idea of making your digital assets hidden from the public eye for good. As the name implies, it works by mixing your coins with those in our cryptocurrency reserves to ensure private transactions without a trace. CryptoMixer helps you make your BTCs unidentifiable and, thus, allows you to rest easy knowing that neither crypto-hackers nor security agencies can keep track of your financial activities.</p>

      <section class="section-3 pb-5">
        <h5 class="seo1">Why our Bitcoin tumbler stands out from the rest</h5>
        <p class="seo">What forms the pillar of CryptoMixer is that it has been designed with the needs of Bitcoin community members in mind. It is your privacy and security that underpin our mixing service and encourage us to turn all decentralized opportunities to your advantage. That is why we’ve done our utmost to incorporate the following features into our Bitcoin blender:</p>
        <ul class="list-unstyled">
          <li class="strong">The highest level of protection</li>
          <p class="seo">Our servers use advanced encryption methods to ensure the integrity of all data stored and minimize the risk of the Blockchain analysis. What is more, we provide every user with a unique code to prevent mixing their coins with the ones they’ve sent to us before. Apart from that, we regularly delete all details of your transactions, including incoming Bitcoin addresses.</p>
          <li class="strong">Impressive mixing capabilities</li>
          <p class="seo">Whether you’re looking to mix 0.001 BTC or several hundreds of coins, you won’t find a more convenient service than our Bitcoin tumbler. CryptoMixer has over 2000 BTC in its cryptocurrency reserves, which allows you to exchange large amounts of BTC without waiting for other users to send their coins for mixing.</p>
          <li class="strong"> Low fees and the Letter of Guarantee</li>
          <p class="seo">While other Bitcoin mixing services charge 1% and more for each transaction, CryptoMixer helps you avoid overspending. Our fees start only at 0.5% + 0.0005 BTC and can be customized to make it impossible for third parties to spot the connection between addresses.</p>
